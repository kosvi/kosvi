# üëã My (coder) CV

### Where is all started

I have written html and php in my own personal uh.. projects for quite some time, but there is nothing to brag about them. They can basically be considered as one big giant pile of anti-pattern. \
In those projects I did sometimes use javascript, but mostly something I took from another website and somehow managed to get to work in my projects. Ofter all the dynamic stuff was made by changing
the javascript code with php before rendering. 

It all started to change when I started doing SoloLearn courses on my cellphone and I learn there is a word "class" in javascript. So my first project I like to introduce is...


### üêç js-snake

[Snake](https://github.com/kosvi/js-experiments/tree/master/snake) was written in vanilla javascript. It is not a beauty, but it's the project that really got me into programming. I can't say for sure, but I guess 
it was written somewhere around autumn 2019 or winter 2019-2020. There is an [online version](http://www.roskakori.net/snake/) available for enthusiasts. 



### üêâ ultimate-rpg

After "the Snake" came COVID-19 and we went to remote teaching with my pupils. Once we got back to school, we had some spare time and I wrote [the-ultimate-rpg](https://github.com/kosvi/js-experiments/tree/master/ultimate-rpg) for my pupils with my pupils. First version wasn't really playable with phone, so version2 scales better for mobile. Version3 never came out. Still, no real beauty - simply hacked together in couple of hours. Again, [online version](http://www.roskakori.net/tmp/rpg2/) is available at least at the time of writing. 



## Started my studies

At this point, I started my IT-studies at the Haaga-Helia university of applied sciences. I took some programming courses and the end of spring, 
but they didn't give me much at this point. Later I started taking courses from University of Helsinki Open University and they prooved to be
something that really made me advance in programming along with my Haaga-Helia courses. 

During this time, I wrote a lot of code, but mostly for courses and I don't feel like I have much to put on my portfolio. However, there are 
two things I like to showcase here. 



### üèãÔ∏è Trainer

I took a frontend development course in Haaga-Helia and at the end of the course, we had to make a [trainer](https://github.com/kosvi/SWD4TN026-3012/tree/main/trainer) for a given backend. That probably isn't a really cool and shining frontend, but there are couple of 
nice things in the source code. This is probably first ever project I've written to be even that readable and maintainable. 



### üñºÔ∏è rate-my-desktop

Another course I took was a spring boot -course. My project for the course was an application called [rate-my-desktop](https://github.com/kosvi/Rate-my-desktop). It aint no beauty either, but a clear example on how I was advancing as a developer. Sorry, no live demo available!



### Additional study projects

Finally I want to mention two not so huge projects: [Kmeans](https://github.com/kosvi/kmeans) and [TicketGuru](https://github.com/kosvi/ohjelmistoprojekti). 

Neither of them are a big deal. Kmeans was a small project for a course and probably the first time I implemented a known algoritm in a project of my own. TicketGuru on the other hand was a project we did, while learning scrum in practise. The original repo is gone, but I managed to fork a copy before it was deleted. 



## Going deeper to rabbit hole

At this point (somewhere around summer 2021) I started going even deeper to coding. At this point, I had some knowledge of good practices, 
agile methodology, I had better knowledge on how computers work and communicate, I knew some of the basic algorithm and data structures and 
I was advancing fast!



### üéÖ Santas Own CRM

During winter 2021-2022 I took a course called Full Stack Open. At the end of the course there is an optional project work I decided to complete it in full scale. My project was called [Santas-own-CRM](https://github.com/kosvi/Santas_own_CRM). There are many cool things I did in it, even though
I was quite new to TypeScript (this is my first ever project done with it). I wrote some final [reflections](https://github.com/kosvi/Santas_own_CRM/blob/master/Docs/summary.md) once the project was "done" (sorry, only in Finnish). I will probably not continue my work with this project, since my time is limited and I already have another project going on...



### üîë login-service

At the time of writing, I am working on a [login-service](https://github.com/kosvi/login-service). It is supposed to be a simple SSO-service
that can be used to authenticate users for various (upcoming) projects of my own. It's written in TypeScript and I try to keep dependencies
to minimum (no Express.js, no ORM, etc.)
